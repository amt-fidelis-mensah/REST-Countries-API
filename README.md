# - REST Countries API

The challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V2 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs (Figma file). I was required to use the Angular +
TypeScript front-end framework. However, I have complete control over which
packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an **input** field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Filter countries by region
- Toggle the colour scheme between light and dark mode

### What I learned

This section is to provide a recap of some of the major learnings done while working through the project.
The major ones are:
Components
Services
Observables
Routing
Emitter
ngModule
HttpRequest and many others

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
API & ANGULAR

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<input type="number" class="height-input-value ft-value" placeholder="0" min="0" required />
```

```css
/* Ways to remove the arrows in an input field*/
/* For WebKit-based browsers */
input[type="number"]::-webkit-inner-spin-button,
input[type="number"]::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  margin: 0;
}

/* For Mozilla Firefox */
input[type="number"]::-moz-number-spin-box {
  -moz-appearance: textfield;
}
```

```js
const updateBMI = () => {
  console.log('...ðŸŽ‰')
}
 const updateBMI = () => {
    //Calculate THE BMI in kg and cm

    const heightInCm: number = parseFloat(inputHeight.val() as string);
    const weightInKg: number = parseFloat(inputWeight.val() as string);

    if (isNaN(heightInCm) || isNaN(weightInKg)) {
      welcomeBlock.show();
      resultBlock.hide();

      return;
    }
```

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me with the the responsiveness and the countryc card. I really liked how this framework help with the media query.
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - The project was biult with Angular, and on like any other, Angular has features that makes programming easy and provides clean codes.
- [API-Country](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) - Use this to access all the data I needed for the project.
- [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand TypeScript. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. A reader who completes the walkthrough should be able to:
  - Read and understand commonly-used TypeScript syntax and patterns
  - Explain the effects of important compiler options
  - Correctly predict type system behavior in most cases

# RESTCountriesAPI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
